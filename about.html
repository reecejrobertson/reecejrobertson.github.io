            <h1>Education History</h1>
            <p>
                Reece Robertson is a computer science PhD student at the Univeristy of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), with a projected graduation year of 2027.
                He is under the mentorship of Dr. Samuel Lomonaco and Dr. Sebastian Deffner, and he is a member of the Quantum Thermodynamics group.
                In 2022 he received his BS in applied and computational mathematics, with a minor in computer science, from Brigham Young University (BYU).

            <h1>Research Statement</h1>
            <p>
                It is well known that some computational problems are difficult to solve (e.g. those in the class NP).
                One such problem is the modeling of quantum systems.
                Realizing this, in the 1980s the visionary Richard Feynman proposed the idea of a computer founded upon the principles of quantum mechanics.
                These computers, Feynman claimed, could perform complex computations that are out of reach of regular (hereafter called classical) computers.

            <p>
                Forty years later the field of quantum computing is thriving.
                Several different quantum systems have been leveraged to build quantum computers, each approach with its own strengths and weaknesses.
                Moreover, a small host of algorithms that leverage quantum principles have been discovered.

            <h2>Past Research</h2>
            <p>
                During my undergraduate degree I studied applied mathematics and computer science at Brigham Young University, thus my interest and skill set lies in the realm of quantum algorithms.
                In an effort to make quantum algorithms more accessible in this time of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum computers, I studied a new form of quantum algorithm simulation which I referred to as quantum <i>emulation.</i>
                Emulation differs from simulation in one important respect: quantum simulation aims to mathematically replicate every step of a quantum algorithm on a classical computer, while quantum emulation uses an existing classical algorithm to abstract an entire quantum simulation into a single optimized computation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was exciting work that allowed me to perform quantum algorithm simulations of large problems.
                As part of my undergraduate honors thesis, I emulated an instance of Shor's famous integer factoring algorithm involving over 40 qubits on my laptop computer, which was over twice as many qubits as I could reliably simulate on the same device.
                Thus, my emulator allows quantum algorithm developers to work on <i>noiseless</i> intermediate-scale classical simulations that are comparable to current quantum computers.
            </p>
            <h2>Future Research</h2>
            <p>
                All signs indicate that large quantum computers are on the horizon.
                IBM, one of the global leaders in quantum technologies, has predicted that they will build a computer with <a href='https://www.ibm.com/quantum/roadmap'>several thousand qubits by 2026</a>, and they may attain hundreds of thousands by the end of the decade.
                The amount of processing power quantum computers of this size may leverage is unfathomable, surpassing what would be achieved by a classical computer made from every atom in the known universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The potential applications of these quantum computers is likewise limitless.
                With the proper algorithms we could use these computers to model chemical systems to aid in drug development, to optimally lay out qubit placement to design even better quantum computers, and to realize Feynman's original dream of fully modeling a quantum system, to name just a few potential applications.
                My future work will be devoted to developing efficient, error resistant algorithms to solve these problems.
                I will study methods of speeding up existing classical algorithms on a quantum computer, as well as working to design original algorithms that fully leverage the quantum effects of superposition, entanglement, and measurement.
